# SD CARD

## AIM 
The aim was to create an app that utilises the external storage of the smartphone. 

## MOTIVATION BEHIND THE PROJECT
SD card or Removable Storage, inspite of having its own unique challenges, has been a sort after feature. The cost effectiveness, freedom of expansion, portability of sd card motivated me to create an app which can take the support of external storage and store the data there. 

## FEATURES
I have already created mis.txt file through codes for reading and writing the data into the file. Once the program runs, it automatically creates the file “mil.txt” and stores it in the SD card. The Mulitext view allows you to write content without any word limit and it can display the contents of a large file with ease. The clear button helps in clearing the multi text view for the user’s use

## HOW TO USE
### If running in virtual device
1) GO to notification centre and there will “Set UP Virtual SD Card” Option. Tap that
2) In the pop up it will request you to select either “Set as phone storage” or “set as external storage”. Select the former for easy setup.
3) Once clicking Next, it will request for moving the contents of the phone files to external storage, press “Move contents”
4) After that, it will request for storage locations, press “Set up later”
5) The pop up message “SD card is ready to use” indicates the job is done right
6) Now run the app. Once the app is launched it requests for permission. Grant it
7) Now you can use the app successfully

### If running in real device
1) Once the phone is connected to the PC, run the app
2) Once the app is launched it will request for permission. Grant it
3) You will be able to use the app now 

**NOTE: The app does not collect any user data and the data written and read by the user is stored locally in the virtual device/phone’s storage**
