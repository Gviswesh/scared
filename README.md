# SD CARD

## AIM 
The aim was to create an app that utilises the external storage of the smartphone. 

## MOTIVATION BEHIND THE PROJECT
An SD card or Removable Storage, inspite of having its own unique challenges, is a sought after feature. The cost effectiveness, freedom of expansion and portability of an sd card motivated me to create an app which can take the support of external storage and store the data on such an easily accessible removable storage accessory. 

## FEATURES
I have already created a mis.txt file through codes for reading and writing the data into the file. In my version, once the program runs, it automatically creates the file “mil.txt” and stores it to the SD card. The Multitext view allows you to write content without any word limit and it can display the contents of a large file with ease. The clear button helps in clearing the multi text view for the user’s use

## HOW TO USE
### If running in virtual device
1) GO to the notification centre and tap the “Set UP Virtual SD Card” Option. 
2) A pop up will appear and request you to select either “Set as phone storage” or “set as external storage”. Select the former for easy setup.
3) After clicking Next, verify moving the contents of the phone files to external storage, pressing “Move contents”
4) When asked to request for storage locations, press “Set up later”
5) The pop up message “SD card is ready to use” indicates the job is completed accurately
6) Now run the app. Once the app is launched you will need to grant permission
7) Now you can use the app successfully

### If running in real device
1) Once the phone is connected to the PC, run the app
2) Once the app is launched you will need to grant the permission
3) The app is now functional

**NOTE: The app does not collect any user data and the data written and read by the user is stored locally in the virtual device/phone’s storage**
